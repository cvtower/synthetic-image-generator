# synthetic-image-generator
synthetic image generator for object detection/segmentation network training

This tool was developed for utilizing the opencv interface to generate synthetic image(with 3d transform) samples with alternative background for object detection/segmentation network training. Currently, it contains alternative implementions including c++ and python. c++ version will released later.

For previous project, i write this script to generate huge size of synthetic ocr images with random background as well as the corresponding annotation files. It works fine and helps a lot to the network training task.

Hope it will be helpful.
